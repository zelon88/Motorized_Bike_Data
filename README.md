# Motorized_Bike_Data
A repo to contain data in various formats related to motorized bicycle configurations.

This Github repository exists for the purpose of collecting as much verifiable motorized bicycle data as possible. Doing so will greatly benefit the motorized bike community significantly by allowing users to cross reference the expected performance characteristics of a new build with builds that already exist.

In order to achieve a reliable data set, a submission must contain a minimum amount of data. The format for submissions is currently very flexible, so feel free to start a discussion on the [Issues](https://github.com/zelon88/Motorized_Bike_Data/issues) page so we can hash out the details. Specifically the minimum requirements for a data submission, the overall format for a contribution, important data to record, and methods for verifying the validity of submissions.
